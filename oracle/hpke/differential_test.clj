  "This implementation against BouncyCastle's HPKE, over many key pairs and
  message sequences.

  A separate source root reached only by the `:oracle` alias, because
  BouncyCastle must never become a dependency: it is what this is CHECKED
  AGAINST, not something it builds on.

      clojure -M:oracle

  The known-answer suite pins one ephemeral against one recipient. What it
  leaves untested is everything that varies: other key pairs, other `info`,
  other aad and plaintext lengths, and the sequence number past the first few
  messages -- which is where `compute-nonce`'s big-endian counter would show
  an error only after a carry crossed a byte."
