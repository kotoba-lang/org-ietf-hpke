  "Extract RFC 9180 Appendix A.2 — DHKEM(X25519, HKDF-SHA256), HKDF-SHA256,
  ChaCha20Poly1305 — into `test/hpke/rfc9180_vectors.cljc`.

  A.2 is this library's suite exactly, and it publishes all four modes. So the
  vectors are the RFC's rather than another implementation's, for every mode.

  ## Why this is a script and not a hand-transcription

  An earlier draft of this repository's test suite claimed its vectors were
  A.2 verbatim and they were not: the recalled `ikmR` was A.1's. The pairing
  happened to be internally consistent, so nothing caught it except an
  assertion on `pkRm`. Transcription is the step that failed, so it is the
  step that is now mechanical.

  **All seven appendices** are extracted. Between them they pin every axis
  this library parameterises: A.1/A.2/A.7 share a KEM and a KDF and differ
  only in the AEAD, A.3/A.4/A.5 share a KEM and differ in KDF and AEAD — A.4
  being the one that pairs DHKEM(P-256, **HKDF-SHA256**) with **HKDF-SHA512**,
  which is the case that proves the KEM keeps its own KDF — and A.6 is P-521
  throughout.

  They do **not** cover P-384 or X448. Nothing here pretends otherwise.

  ## Why the input is pinned by hash

  A vector file regenerated from a different document is a different claim.
  If rfc-editor.org ever serves something else under this URL, this refuses
  rather than quietly rewriting the fixtures.
